# BuildXact Saudi

A construction management & job costing SaaS platform for Saudi Arabia's contractors,
builders, and developers — inspired by [BuildXact](https://www.buildxact.com/), rebuilt from
scratch in plain PHP for the Saudi market (bilingual Arabic/English, SAR pricing, ZATCA-ready
invoice numbering).

The platform has three parts, all in this repository:

1. **Public marketing website** — home, features, pricing (SAR, monthly/yearly), about, contact.
   Bilingual (English/Arabic) with full right-to-left layout support.
2. **User panel** (`/app`) — the software each subscribing contractor company uses day to day:
   dashboard, projects, estimates (with line items), invoices (with line items), client CRM,
   scheduling, team management, billing/subscription, and company settings. Fully multi-tenant:
   every company only ever sees its own data.
3. **Admin panel** (`/admin`) — the platform owner's back office: revenue/MRR overview, company
   management (activate/suspend), subscription plan management, payment ledger, and admin user
   management.

## Tech stack

Plain PHP 8.1+ with a small hand-rolled MVC core (router, PDO models, session auth, PHP-template
views) — no framework dependency, so it runs anywhere PHP runs. Works against **SQLite** out of
the box for zero-setup local development/demo, or **MySQL** for production (switch with one
`.env` value).

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php database/migrate.php --seed-demo   # creates tables + seeds plans, admin, and a demo company
php -S localhost:8000 -t public public/router.php
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

**Demo logins** (also shown on the login page):

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Platform admin | `admin@buildxact-saudi.local` | `Admin@12345` |
| Demo company owner | `owner@buildxact-saudi.local` | `Demo@12345` |

The demo company ("Al Rashid Construction Co.") comes pre-loaded with a client, a project, an
accepted estimate, a paid invoice, and a schedule — so the user panel isn't empty on first login.

Drop `--seed-demo` if you only want the platform admin account and default plans (e.g. for a
fresh production database).

## Configuration (`.env`)

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DB_DRIVER` | `sqlite` (default, zero setup) or `mysql` |
| `DB_SQLITE_PATH` | Path to the SQLite file when `DB_DRIVER=sqlite` |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_DATABASE` / `DB_USERNAME` / `DB_PASSWORD` | Used when `DB_DRIVER=mysql` |
| `TRIAL_DAYS` | Length of the free trial offered at signup |
| `DEFAULT_CURRENCY` | Displayed currency (SAR by default) |
| `PAYMENT_GATEWAY*` | Placeholder for a real Saudi payment gateway integration (see below) |

To run on MySQL: create a database, set `DB_DRIVER=mysql` and the `DB_*` credentials in `.env`,
then run `php database/migrate.php`.

## Data model / multi-tenancy

Every subscriber is a **company**. A company has many **users** (the owner plus invited team
members), and owns its own **clients**, **projects**, **estimates** (→ `estimate_items`),
**invoices** (→ `invoice_items`), and **schedule_tasks**. All user-panel queries are scoped by
`company_id`, so companies can never see each other's data. The **platform admin** (`role =
super_admin`, no `company_id`) sits outside any company and manages the platform itself:
companies, plans, and payments.

Billing is modeled with **plans** (Starter / Professional / Enterprise, monthly+yearly SAR
pricing) and **subscriptions** (one company can have a history of subscriptions as it
upgrades/downgrades); **payments** records each charge. `BillingController::upgrade()` is where
plan changes happen today, and it simulates a successful charge — see below for wiring up a real
gateway.

## What's intentionally out of scope for this MVP

BuildXact itself is a mature, years-in-the-making product (detailed takeoffs, supplier price
lists, Gantt scheduling, mobile apps, accounting integrations, etc.). This build focuses on
standing up the three-part platform (marketing site → subscription → user panel; admin panel to
run it) with the core contractor workflow (estimate → project → schedule → invoice) fully
working end to end, so it's a real foundation to extend rather than a mockup. Notable gaps to be
aware of before going to production:

- **Payment gateway**: `PAYMENT_GATEWAY=manual` is a stub. For Saudi Arabia, wire up
  [Moyasar](https://moyasar.com), [HyperPay](https://hyperpay.com), [PayTabs](https://paytabs.com),
  or [Tap](https://tap.company) in `BillingController::upgrade()` (currently it just records a
  "paid" payment immediately).
- **ZATCA e-invoicing**: invoice numbering is sequential per company, but full ZATCA Phase 2
  compliance (QR codes, XML/UBL format, cryptographic stamps) is not implemented.
- **Email**: no transactional email (welcome email, invoice delivery, password reset) is wired
  up yet — plug in a provider (e.g. an SMTP relay) in `AuthController` and `TeamController`.
  Team-member invites currently show the temporary password directly in the UI as a placeholder
  for "send this by email."
- **File uploads / documents**: no attachment support on projects/estimates yet.
- **Password reset flow**: not implemented; an admin can only re-invite via the Team page.

## Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with `password_hash()` (bcrypt by default in PHP).
- All state-changing POST requests are protected with a per-session CSRF token
  (`App\Core\Csrf`).
- All output is escaped via `View::e()` (`htmlspecialchars`).
- All queries use PDO prepared statements — no raw string interpolation of user input into SQL.
- Every user-panel query is scoped to `Auth::companyId()`, and every resource lookup
  (`findOwned()` in each controller) verifies the record belongs to the logged-in user's company
  before it's shown or modified.
